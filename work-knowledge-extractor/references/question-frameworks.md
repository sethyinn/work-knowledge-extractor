## Generic Fallback Questions

When unsure which category applies, use these universal questions:

### For Any Stage
- **Activities**: "What actually happens in this stage? Walk me through it step by step."
- **Outputs**: "What exists after this stage that didn't exist before?"
- **Evaluation**: "How would you explain to someone else whether this stage was done well?"

### Deepening Questions
- "Can you give me a specific example of that?"
- "What's a common mistake people make in this stage?"

### Completeness Checks
- "Is there anything about [stage] we haven't discussed?"
